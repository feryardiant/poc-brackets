# Tournamen Bracket

The main goal of this project is to learn how generate single-elimination tournament bracket based on number of participant as simple as possible.

- **No build process** - Uses native `esm` that already natively supported by all major browsers
- **No dependencies** - I don't want to be tied to any libraries or frameworks
